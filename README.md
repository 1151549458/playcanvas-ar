# PlayCanvasAR - Easy AR for the Web
PlayCanvasAR makes it *easy* to build *lightning fast* augmented reality applications. With it, you can construct web-based AR applications with *zero programming* using the PlayCanvas Editor. Just drag in your 3D models and watch them appear in AR!

But if you want to create something more interactive, you can call on the full power of the [PlayCanvas scripting API](https://developer.playcanvas.com/en/api/).

## Demo
Before you begin, print out the following markers: [Hiro](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5/blob/master/doc/patterns/Hiro%20pattern.pdf) and [Kanji](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5/blob/master/doc/patterns/Kanji%20pattern.pdf).

Now click [here](https://playcanv.as/p/eJ1ygzym/) for a demonstration. We recommend running it on mobile (but if you use iOS, make sure you are on version 11).

## Performance
PlayCanvasAR delivers 60 frames per second, even on mobile.

## Tracking by ARToolkit
PlayCanvasAR utilizes the amazing [ARToolkit](https://artoolkit.org/), an open source marker-based tracking library. Originally coded in C++, it has been [ported to JavaScript](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5) using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

## Visuals by PlayCanvas
PlayCanvas provides an advanced WebGL graphics engine. It supports the latest WebGL 2 graphics API and implements Physically Based Rendering to achieve incredible visuals for your AR applications. And yes, that's open sourced too.
