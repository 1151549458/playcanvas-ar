# PlayCanvasAR - Easy AR for the Web
PlayCanvasAR makes it *easy* to build *lightning fast* augmented reality applications. With it, you can construct web-based AR applications with *zero programming* using the PlayCanvas Editor. Just drag in your 3D models and watch them appear in AR!

But if you want to create something more interactive, you can call on the PlayCanvas scripting API.

## Performance
PlayCanvasAR delivers 60 frames per second, even on mobile.

## Tracking by ARToolkit
PlayCanvasAR utilizes the amazing [ARToolkit](https://artoolkit.org/), an open source marker-based tracking library. Originally coded in C++, it has been [ported to JavaScript](https://github.com/artoolkit/jsartoolkit5) using [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

## Visuals by PlayCanvas
PlayCanvas provides an advanced WebGL graphics engine. It supports the latest WebGL 2 graphics API and implements Physically Based Rendering to achieve incredible visuals for your AR applications. And yes, that's open sourced too.

## Getting Started with PlayCanvasAR

1. Create an account on playcanvas.com (if you haven't already).
2. Fork the [AR Starter Kit](https://playcanvas.com/project/481413/overview) project (which contains the latest version of playcanvas-ar.js).
3. Hit the launch button and see AR in action (we recommend using your mobile device!).
